# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

# Context
This project focuses on the static website development for a popular Singaporean 1960’s rock band called The Quests. They were widely considered among the most successful Singapore bands of the 1960s and 1970s. Most notable, The Quests made the news in 1965 when their song ‘Be My Girl’ reached the top spot on Singapore’s hit music charts. 

The website was designed as a tribute page for The Quests. The intention of the website development was to store some of their music, new articles and photos throughout their years active. Through the website, both young and old-time fans can reminisce the band’s legacy of rock and roll.

User and Organisation Goal 5:

# (2) Scope of Project 
<Skeleton>

Based on requirements identified, the website was designed with the following sections:

Home – Landing page with short introduction of the band 
Music – Page with band’s discography and band recordings 
History – Page with an article of the band’s history
Tour – Page listing band’s upcoming tour schedule  
Gallery – Photo gallery of the band’s past and more recent performance 

<Design Choices>
The brownish-red and maroon theme can be seen repeated through the different pages as they were selected to accentuate the band’s passion for performance and rock and roll. The white accents, background and choice of font typographies were also selected to give the website a sleek yet refreshed look while highlighting their rich and long history. 

The band’s logo was also updated into a modern look using a third party service, Canva.

Additionally, to bolster a personal connection with fans through the website, photos of the band members and personal quotes from the band members were strategically placed across the pages.   

# Features
# (1) Existing Features
Fans can get updates on the band’s activities via the newsletter, by having filling up a newsletter form on the ‘Home‘ page.
The list of the band’s discography contains links which redirects users to purchase the album if they are interested on the ‘Music’ page. 

Fans are able to listen to a few tracks from the band on the ‘Music’ page via a SoundCloud player.

An article about the band is captured on the ‘History’ page to give users a more comprehensive view of the band’s origin.  

Fans can check out the band’s tour schedule by clicking on the button on the ‘Tour Dates’ page.

The band’s past and more recent photographs are featured in a collage for the fan’s viewing pleasure on the ‘Gallery’ page. 
# (2) Additional Features to be implemented in the future
In the future, I would like to add more media articles of the band into the ‘history’ page and also another section to the ‘gallery’ page with a video gallery that contains the band’s interviews and past performances.
# (3) Features Left to Implement 
The webpages have only been designed to be mobile-responsive from small to medium devices (i.e. mobile phones to laptops). Mobile-responsiveness should also be implemented for large devices such as a desktop monitor.

# Testing 
# (1) Manual Testing
On every webpage, users will see a navigation bar that is pegged to the top of the page and a footer bag that is pegged to the bottom of the page.

<Navigation Bar>
Users will see 5 tabs  and 1 logo.
When users move their mouse cursor and hover above any of the tabs on the Navigation Bar, they will see the tab being underlined.
When users click on the underlined tab, they will be redirected to:
‘HOME’ redirects to https://samlookingglass.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project/home.html
‘MUSIC’ redirects tohttps://samlookingglass.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project/music.html
‘HISTORY’ redirects to https://samlookingglass.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project/history.html
‘TOUR’ redirects to https://samlookingglass.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project/tour.html
‘GALLERY’ redirects to https://samlookingglass.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project/gallery.html
‘QUESTS’ logo redirects to https://samlookingglass.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project/home.html


<Footer Bar>
When users move their mouse cursor and hover above any of the icons on the Footer bar, they will see the icons being highlighted in black.

When users click on the highlighted icons, the link will pop up in another separate page:
‘Spotify’ – redirects to https://open.spotify.com/artist/4AOgY5YwQw4d5pgEX3f56A
‘YouTube’ – redirects to https://www.youtube.com/user/JoeWuSeattleWaUSA/featured

<Home Page>
When users land on the home page, they will see an animated background of a vinyl record player and an animation at the bottom right of the screen that says “scroll down”.

As this is a static page, when users click on the subscribe button on the Get Updates Form, they will not see their form being sent or being validated.

However, when users click on the Country field on the form, they should see a drop-down list with the names of the countries they can choose from.

<Music Page>
Users will see four SoundCloud players with the tracks ‘Shanty’, ‘Hanky Panky’, ‘Rock n Roll Yodelling Guy – Sakura and the Quests’ and ‘Keith Locke & The Quests – Don’t Play That Song (You Lied)’.
Users will also see a list of the band’s discography with highlighted link to purchase the album if they click on it.
When users click on the highlighted link, the link redirect user to a separate pop-up page. 

<History Page>
Users will see an article titled ‘How The Quests’ Shanty Shaped Singapore’s Pop Scene’ with a link to the original article.

<Tour Page>
Users will see a ‘Tour Dates’ button. 
When users click on the button, a modal box will pop up with the message ‘There are currently no tours in your area.’

<Gallery Page>
Users will see 33 photos of the band members in a grid-style collage.

# (2) Mobile-responsive
The webpages work on small to medium devices (i.e. mobile phones to laptops). 
# (3) Bugs
For viewing on small devices and larger devices, certain html elements are not re-scaling properly to the size of the device the webpage is being viewed on. Examples of these are quotes box, images and SoundCloud iframes not rescaling.

# Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/SamLookingGlass/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Project into your terminal. 

To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.

The current deployed version of the website does contain the band’s performance video on the ‘history’ page whereas on the development version, the video and code is available for use.
